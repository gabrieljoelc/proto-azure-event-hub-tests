# Welcome to Azure Event Hub Tests üëã

> This project is for testing our ability to run multiple instances of webjob's on the same Event Hub consumer group. We want to understand 2 things: 1. does it maintain order and 2. does it achieve higher throughput.

## Install

```sh
Run terraform apply in the devops directory and then execute the deploy.sh file in the consumer project (you will need to set a couple of environment variables)
```

## Usage

```sh
Load a hub with lots of messages and then turn on the web job or web jobs.
```
